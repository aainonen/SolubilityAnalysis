# Solubility Analysis: Project Overview

Curated solubility database (Sorkun et al. 2019) was used as data source. Database contains 
9982 molecule's curated solubility and molecular descriptor data.

Jupyter notebook contains my analysis using Python (Pandas) and machine learning techniques (Skicit-learn).

### Project overview:

- Handled data with Pandas-library (feature selection, categorical values coding)
- Explored data by creating a correlation matrix, bar charts, whisker pltos and histograms
- Performed PCA-analysis and visualization
- Modelled solubility with Skicit-learn regression algorithms
    - Skicit-learn model_selection package to split data into training and testing subsets (20 % test)
